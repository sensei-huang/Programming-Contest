Skills needed(team members do not need every skill but overall your team should have/develop most if not all of these skills):
---
Physical typing
 - Typing(usually bursts of typing with minimal mistakes)
 - Fluency in coding language(this is acquired through practice. It will be very advantageous to remember function names)
---
Reading and thinking
 - Comprehension(being able to understand the problem and sample inputs quickly yet thoroughly)
 - Algorithimic thinking(ability to create simple yet somewhat efficient(well, enough to evade the time limit) algorithms. Use brute force within reason)
 - Creative thinking(ability to attack problem from all angles and find a unique way to solve your solution efficiently)
---
Editing and reviewing
 - Debugging(being able to have an efficient way to find, understand and fix an error)
 - Testing(although the sample inputs are often sufficient, being able to test your parts of your own code is very useful)
---
Management and team spirit
 - Teamwork(knowing what roles everyone does and working together)
 - Time management(knowing how to spend your time wisely)
 - Perseverance(not giving up and consistently working on problems)
