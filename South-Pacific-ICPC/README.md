**TLDR**: Simply put, you should probably practice either the problem set ending with **D** or the one ending in **DA**. If you want to practice more, practice the problem sets ending with R. 

| File suffix | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| D | Divisional(To qualify into regionals) |
| R | Regional(Only can get in if you qualify divisional) |
| DA/DB | DA is the higher level division and the one you need to go to regionals while DB is for beginners. |
| R1/R2 | This was due to COVID-19 and so there was only 1 competition and 2 divisions |

| Suffix | Difficulty(Higher is harder) |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| R | 6 |
| R2 | 5 |
| R1 | 4 |
| D | 3 |
| DA | 2 |
